Abstract of Subost-
Subost is a multi-server on Discord with the purpose and goal of combining and elevating community servers into one main sevrer where everyone can lean something new from one anther. We have several rules and policies to keep Subost safe and in shape that is suitable enough for young teens to feel comfortable.
We do not support racial servers as well as gorey context servers; Servers with the intent of degrading other races, people, or groups are also forbidden to be advertised (broadcasted) in all of our servers.

This is a non-profit multi-server and only kept with volunteer staff who do their job(s) for the 'fun of it'. We are responsible and fair and hear everyone's voice.
